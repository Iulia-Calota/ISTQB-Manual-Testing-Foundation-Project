# Test project Fenty Beauty 

For this project, I am using Fenty Beauty (FEИTY BEAUTY), a cosmetics brand by Rihanna. The mission statement for the brand is: 

**"So that people everywhere would be included and is created for everyone."**

## Sprint 2 Weeks:

## 1.Introduction

- Static and Dynamic testing
- Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)


### Static testing
- Early Phase: Begins early in the SDLC.

- Quality Evaluation: 
    - Evaluates the quality and builds confidence in work products like requirements, code analysis, test plans, test cases, and product backlogs.
Benefits: 
    - Early testing saves time and money, fulfilling the principle of “Early testing saves time & money.”
Stakeholder Involvement: 
    - Involves various stakeholders to review and improve the product.

###  Dynamic Testing

- Triggering Failures:
    -  Identifies defects and triggering failures.
- Functionality Validation: 
    - Verifying and Validates the functionality of the website **[https://fentybeauty.com]**
- Test types:
    - Functional Testing, Non- Functional Testing, Black box testing

###  Objectives of testing

-  Ensures the software is reliable, efficient, and meets user requirements.
-  Triggers failures and identifies defects.
-  Reduces the risk of inadequate software quality.
-  Builds confidence in the test object, contributing to decisions to move to the next SDLC stage, such as the release decision.

### Testing principles used:

- Early Testing: 
    - Saves time and money; early review of test design, requirements, test plan, test cases, and code analysis is cost-effective for finding and fixing defects.
- Defect Clustering: 
    - Follows the Pareto principle where a small number of modules contain most defects. This insight is crucial for risk-based testing.
- Context Dependency: 
    - Testing varies based on context; different software systems have different risk levels, requiring different approaches, tools, and technologies.

## Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

 ~~After planning the objectives, principles, and test approaches, we defined the entry and exit criteria, executed the test suites, generated reports, and completed the test process, making the project ready for a new version release.
~~

# Entry Criteria
- Review the Fenty website's specifications for "Favorites" and "Sign in" functionalities.
- Identify the key functionalities to be tested.
- Create a requirements traceability matrix (RTM) to map requirements to test cases.
- User stories or use cases are complete and reviewed.
- Test suites/ Test cases are written, reviewed, and mapped to requirements.
- Test data is prepared, validated, and available.
- Agile methodology : **Scrum** (Sprint 2 weeks)
- Environment: **Prod**
- Team: **Calota Iulia** -**Quality Assurance/ Tester**

# Exit Criteria

- User Experience: Usability testing shows that the website is **user-friendly** and accesible.
- Cross-Check Compatibility: The website is **tested across various browsers**, ensuring responsive design.
- Analytics tools are correctly implemented and **reporting**.

### 1. Test Planning

**Objective**: Plan the testing process.
**Activities:**
- Define the scope and objectives of testing.
- Identify resources (team members, tools, etc.).
- Estimate time and effort for testing.
**Tools**: 
- Jira (for project management), **TestRail** (for test case management)
**Deliverables:**
- Test Summary Report

## 2. Test Case Development
 **Objective**: Create detailed test cases.
**Activities:**
- Write test cases for **"Favorites"** and **"Sign in"** functionalities.
- Review and get approval for the test cases.
- Tools: TestRail
**Deliverables:**
- Test cases for "Favorites" and "Sign in"

## 2.3 Test Design

- All test cases are written and then examined.
- Jira will be used as the test management tool.
- Zephyr squad will be used as a plugin for Jira.
- The necessary test data for creating a new customer is identified, including name, address, phone number, and email.

## 2.4 Test Implementation

- The following elements are needed to be ready before the test execution phase begins:
- Testing environment is up and running.
- Access to the testing environment is given: UserID:(mngr532768, password: Bugati1@).
- Cycle summary was created.
- Test cases were added to the cycle summary.
- All the test data is available and reviewed (test data=registration was successful, password example, manager user).
- In the implementation phase, tests are created and prepared for execution. However, regression testing, focusing on high-priority tests, will be conducted in later stages as part of the overall testing process.
- Test suites are created (Cycle Summary was created).
- The tests are implemented, and the required test data is created or prepared to be used in the test execution phase
- The necessary equipment and software are installed for testing.

## 2.5 Test Execution

- The tests will be executed on the following browsers: Chrome, Mozilla, IE. If time will be available, we will extend tests on Opera and Brave browsers.
- Bugs will be created based on the failed test cases.
- The full regression testing will be done after new application changes.
- Retesting will be done after a bug is fixed.
- If the site will shut down, we will execute full retesting.
- The regression test will be executed when a problem is solved.
- Write test conditions(What?).
- Analyze the boundary conditions and limits for each functionality. For example, what happens when a customer record is at its data limit?


## 2.6 Test Closure

- 100% tests were executed, and 90% of them are passed.
- No critical issues have Open status.

## 2.7 Test Monitoring and Control

- Various periodic reports will be generated to reflect the current status of the testing process.
- Offering feedback to the QA team and other stakeholders regarding the progress.
- Conveying test results achieved so far to all relevant parties.
- Identifying and tracking relevant test metrics.
- All test cases are written and reviewd.
- Planning and Estimation to determine the future course of action based on the metrics being tracked.
- Prioritize testing efforts in a different way.
- Reorganize test schedules and deadlines.
- Restructure the test environment.
- Reprioritize the test case and conditions.

## Key Aspects of the Project

- Non-functional testing, such as stress or performance testing, was not included in this project.
- Test automation was not considered.
- No support was provided for mobile applications, focusing exclusively on testing web applications.
- Out of the 10 identified bugs:
 7 have been resolved and retested.
 3 bugs remain open.
 These open bugs do not seem to critically impact the production release and can be addressed later.

1. **Detailed Attention to Test Definition:**
   Paying detailed attention to the definition of tests is crucial for project success.

2. **Monitoring Testing Progress:**
   Periodic reporting is essential for monitoring testing progress.

3. **Adjusting the Test Plan:**
   Adjust the test plan based on collected metrics for better efficiency.

4. **Exploring Broader Coverage:**
   In future projects, explore broader coverage of non-functional tests.

5. **Adopting Agile Approach:**
   Consider adopting an agile approach for better adaptability to changes.

Testing was conducted comprehensively, with the majority of tests passing successfully. Ongoing monitoring, reporting, and improvement of testing processes are essential for ensuring a quality final product.
