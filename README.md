Early Phase: Begins early in the SDLC.
Quality Evaluation: Evaluates the quality and builds confidence in work products like requirements, code analysis, test plans, test cases, and product backlogs.
Benefits: Early testing saves time and money, fulfilling the principle of “early testing saves time & money.”
Stakeholder Involvement: Involves various stakeholders to review and improve the product.
Documentation Review: Includes reviewing documents such as Software Requirements Specifications (SRS), High-Level Design (HLD), and Low-Level Design (LLD).
Dynamic Testing:
Failure Detection: Identifies failures and associated defects through subsequent analysis.
Executable Products: Can only be applied to executable work products.
Functionality Validation: Validates the functionality of an application.
Types: Includes Black-box testing and White-box testing.
