# Test project for Fenty Beauty 
 
For this project, I am using Fenty Beauty (FEИTY BEAUTY), a cosmetics brand by Rihanna. The mission statement for the brand is: 

**"So that people everywhere would be included and is created for everyone."**

## Sprint 2 Weeks:

## Introduction

- Static and Dynamic testing
- Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)


### Static testing
- Early Phase: Begins early in the SDLC.

- Quality Evaluation: 
    - Evaluates the quality and builds confidence in work products like requirements, code analysis, test plans, test cases, and product backlogs.
Benefits: 
    - Early testing saves time and money, fulfilling the principle of “Early testing saves time & money.”

###  Dynamic Testing

- Triggering Failures:
    -  Identifies defects and triggering failures.
- Functionality Validation: 
    - Verifying and Validates the functionality of the website **[https://fentybeauty.com]**
- Test types:
    - Functional Testing, Non-Functional Testing, Black box testing

###  Objectives of testing

-  Ensures the software is reliable, efficient, and meets user requirements.
-  Triggers failures and identifies defects.
-  Reduces the risk of inadequate software quality.
-  Builds confidence in the test object, contributing to decisions to move to the next SDLC stage, such as the release decision.

### Testing principles used:

- Early Testing: 
    - Saves time and money; early review of test design, requirements, test plan, test cases, and code analysis is cost-effective for finding and fixing defects.
- Defect Clustering: 
    - Follows the Pareto principle where a small number of modules contain most defects. This insight is crucial for risk-based testing.
- Context Dependency: 
    - Testing varies based on context; different software systems have different risk levels, requiring different approaches, tools, and technologies.

## Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

 ~~After planning the objectives, principles, and test approaches, we defined the entry and exit criteria, executed the test suites, generated reports, and completed the test process, making the project ready for a new version release.
~~

### Entry Criteria

- Review the **Fenty** website's specifications for **"Favorites"** and **"Sign in"** functionalities to be tested.
- User stories (test suites, test cases) are complete and reviewed.
- Test data is prepared, validated, and available.

### Exit Criteria

- User Experience: Usability testing shows that the website is **user-friendly** and accesible.
- Cross-Check Compatibility: The website is **tested across various browsers**, ensuring responsive design.
- Analytics tools are correctly implemented and **reporting**.

### Test Process - Software Testing Life Cycle

### 1. Test Planning

**Objective**: Plan the testing process.

**Activities:**
- Define the scope and objectives of testing.
- Identify resources (team members, tools, etc.).
- Estimate time and effort for testing.

**Tools**: 
- Jira (for project management)

**TestRail** (for test case management)

**Deliverables:**
- Test Summary Report

### 2. Test Design

**Objective:** 
- Create detailed test cases.

**Activities:**
- Write test cases for **"Favorites"** and **"Sign in"** functionalities.
- Review and get approval for the test cases.
- Tools:**TestRail**

**Deliverables:**
- Test cases for "Favorites" and "Sign in"

### 3. Test Implementation

 **Environment Setup**
- Testing environment: **Prod**
- Test data: **Creating new account**
- Devices + Browsers: **PC** ( Windows 11 Pro), **Browsers** (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox)

### 4. Test Execution

**Objective:** 
- Execute the test cases.

**Activities:**
- Execute the test cases as per the test plan.
- Log defects in Jira for any issues found.
- Conformation testing and regression testing after bug fixes.

**Tools:** 
- TestRail (for test execution), Jira (for bug tracking)

**Deliverables:**
- Test execution logs
- Defect reports

### 5. Test monitoring and Control
- Checking of all test activities and the comparison of actual progress against the plan
- Test control involves taking the actions necessary to meet the objectives of testing. 
- The action plan for everything to work as planned, as intended

### 6. Test Cycle Closure

**Objective:** 
- Conclude the testing process.

**Activities:**
- Ensure all planned test cases are executed.
- Confirm all critical bugs are fixed and closed.
- Document the test results and prepare a test summary report.

**Deliverables:**
- Test summary report
