### Risks:

**Project Risks:**
- The risk of team members committing human errors at various stages of the project, including testing activities.
- The risk that one or more team members may become unavailable, thus affecting the progress of the project.
- Uncertainty or lack of communication following testing or the review process, leading to delays or misunderstandings of identified issues.

**Product Risks:**
- Stability risks (crashes, disconnects, etc)
- IE browser might have performance issues
- The web page pagination could be impacted when opened on mobile devices
- Stress conditions might impact the web application
- New browser might not be supported 

## 2.2 Test Analysis

- Analyze the business requirements to ensure all details for creating test conditions are available.
- Identify the functional requirements for each functionality, including what data can be modified, what data can be deleted, and what new customer data can be added.

## 2.3 Test Design

- All test cases are written and then examined.
- Jira will be used as the test management tool.
- Zephyr squad will be used as a plugin for Jira.
- The necessary test data for creating a new customer is identified, including name, address, phone number, and email.

## 2.4 Test Implementation

- The following elements are needed to be ready before the test execution phase begins:
- Testing environment is up and running.
- Access to the testing environment is given: UserID:(mngr532768, password: Bugati1@).
- Cycle summary was created.
- Test cases were added to the cycle summary.
- All the test data is available and reviewed (test data=registration was successful, password example, manager user).
- In the implementation phase, tests are created and prepared for execution. However, regression testing, focusing on high-priority tests, will be conducted in later stages as part of the overall testing process.
- Test suites are created (Cycle Summary was created).
- The tests are implemented, and the required test data is created or prepared to be used in the test execution phase
- The necessary equipment and software are installed for testing.

## 2.5 Test Execution

- Bugs will be created based on the failed test cases.
- The full regression testing will be done after new application changes.
- Retesting will be done after a bug is fixed.
- If the site will shut down, we will execute full retesting.
- The regression test will be executed when a problem is solved.
- Write test conditions(What?).
- Analyze the boundary conditions and limits for each functionality. For example, what happens when a customer record is at its data limit?


## 2.6 Test Closure

## Key Aspects of the Project

- Non-functional testing, such as stress or performance testing, was not included in this project.
- Test automation was not considered.
- No support was provided for mobile applications, focusing exclusively on testing web applications.
- Out of the 10 identified bugs:
 7 have been resolved and retested.
 3 bugs remain open.
 These open bugs do not seem to critically impact the production release and can be addressed later.

1. **Detailed Attention to Test Definition:**
   Paying detailed attention to the definition of tests is crucial for project success.

2. **Monitoring Testing Progress:**
   Periodic reporting is essential for monitoring testing progress.

3. **Adjusting the Test Plan:**
   Adjust the test plan based on collected metrics for better efficiency.

4. **Exploring Broader Coverage:**
   In future projects, explore broader coverage of non-functional tests.

5. **Adopting Agile Approach:**
   Consider adopting an agile approach for better adaptability to changes.

Testing was conducted comprehensively, with the majority of tests passing successfully. Ongoing monitoring, reporting, and improvement of testing processes are essential for ensuring a quality final product.
